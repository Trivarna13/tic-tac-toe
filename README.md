# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

Tic-tac-toe is a classic game that we all know and love. I created a user-friendly interface and implemented the game logic using NumPy for the game board and Pygame for the window display and event handling.

Using NumPy, I created a 3x3 game board to keep track of the players' moves. Pygame allowed me to create an interactive game window, handle user input, and display the game board using custom images for the marks.
